# Scheduled

## Description

I was able to create a 9-5 daily work schedule planner in order to help keep the employee on track through out the work day. Such as when to take lunch, take a break or done for the day at 5pm.

## Usage

The employee can type in their needed notes on each block of hour to help keep track of the daily work schedule and when that hour has past it will indicate that by changing colors as well as a different color for the future.
